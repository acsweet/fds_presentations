Covid 19 Data Loading
==
The main file is a python script with processes for downloading Covid 19 data from various sources.
- Note: the processes can be setup in an automated script, please see the notebook and python script for additional details

A sample notebook is included: <a href=https://github.com/acsweet/fds_presentations/blob/master/covid_19/covid_19_sample_load.ipynb>covid_19_sample_load.ipynb</a>

Transfer Learning with Word Embeddings
==
A brief tour of some of the recent work and progress on word embeddings.
- Note: weight files for many models are required, links are included in the main notebook.

Introduction to APIs for Fetching Data
==
This is a beginner introduction to APIs, what they are, and what you can do with them, with a special focus on python.
- Note: many of the APIs that require some form of authentication need to be registered for to be used.
